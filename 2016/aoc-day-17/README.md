## Day 17: Two Steps Forward

You're trying to access a secure vault protected by a `4x4` grid of small rooms
connected by doors. You start in the top-left room (marked `S`), and you can
access the vault (marked `V`) once you reach the bottom-right room:

```text
#########
#S| | | #
#-#-#-#-#
# | | | #
#-#-#-#-#
# | | | #
#-#-#-#-#
# | | |
####### V
```

Fixed walls are marked with #, and doors are marked with `-` or `|.`

The doors in your current room are either open or closed (and locked) based on
the hexadecimal MD5 hash of a passcode (your puzzle input) followed by a
sequence of uppercase characters representing the path you have taken so far
(`U` for up, `D` for down, `L` for left, and `R` for right).

Only the first four characters of the hash are used; they represent,
respectively, the doors `up`, `down`, `left`, and `right` from your current
position. Any `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, or `f` means that the corresponding door is
open; any other character (any number or `a`) means that the corresponding door
is closed and locked.

To access the vault, all you need to do is reach the bottom-right room; reaching
this room opens the vault and all doors in the maze.

For example, suppose the passcode is `hijkl`. Initially, you have taken no
steps, and so your path is empty: you simply find the MD5 hash of `hijkl` alone.
The first four characters of this hash are ced9, which indicate that up is open
(`c`), down is open (`e`), left is open (`d`), and right is closed and locked
(`9`). Because you start in the top-left corner, there are no "up" or "left"
doors to be open, so your only choice is down.

Next, having gone only one step (down, or `D`), you find the hash of `hijklD`.
This produces `f2bc`, which indicates that you can go back up, left (but that's
a wall), or right. Going right means hashing `hijklDR` to get `5745` - all doors
closed and locked. However, going up instead is worthwhile: even though it
returns you to the room you started in, your path would then be `DU`, opening a
different set of doors.

After going `DU` (and then hashing `hijklDU` to get `528e`), only the right
door is open; after going `DUR`, all doors lock. (Fortunately, your actual
passcode is not `hijkl`).

Passcodes actually used by Easter Bunny Vault Security do allow access to the
vault if you know the right path. For example:

* If your passcode were `ihgpwlah`, the shortest path would be `DDRRRD`.
* With `kglvqrro`, the shortest path would be `DDUDRLRRUDRD`.
* With `ulqzkmiv`, the shortest would be `DRURDRUDDLLDLUURRDULRLDUUDDDRR`.

Given your vault's passcode, what is the shortest path (the actual path, not
just the length) to reach the vault?

Your puzzle answer was `DDRRUDLRRD`.

### Part Two

You're curious how robust this security solution really is, and so you decide to
find longer and longer paths which still provide access to the vault. You
remember that paths always end the first time they reach the bottom-right room (
that is, they can never pass through it, only end in it).

For example:

* If your passcode were `ihgpwlah`, the longest path would take 370 steps.
* With `kglvqrro`, the longest path would be 492 steps long.
* With `ulqzkmiv`, the longest path would be 830 steps long.

What is the length of the longest path that reaches the vault?

Your puzzle answer was `488`.
